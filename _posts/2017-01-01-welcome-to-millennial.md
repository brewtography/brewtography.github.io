This is the first post to ever be posted in the existence of brewtography history, have I sucessfully created a goldmine of a blog with limitless potential? Who knows, but this is just an introductory gag post to say hi to anyone who may stumble across my site during their travels as an internet explorer (lol). 

This blog is dedicated to all things coffee and cameras, this includes coffee equipment, monthly reviews of local coffee roasters, reviews of new equipment and different recipes I come across and conversely, going over different camera equipment, photo-reviewing and daily posts of some of my favorite photographic work.

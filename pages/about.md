## Firstly, welcome! 

My name is Brew, I am a creative who works in the media industry and have experience professionally as a Videographer, Photographer and a nuisance; this blog exists as both an opinionated information hub and somewhat of a passion project from a creative who has always had the idea of typing up into the abyss! So please, feel free to hunker down and enjoy all that I have to offer!
